# Contributing

Is this game missing your favorite emoji?

To contribute, please make a pull request with at least the name of the emoji, it's character and if it is a food or not to the backend/db/seeds.rb file.

Here's how I would add ðŸ¥“ (bacon)

```ruby
Emoji.create(slug: "bacon", character: "ðŸ¥“", is_food?: true)
```
